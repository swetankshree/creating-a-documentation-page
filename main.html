                    JavaScript is a cross-platform object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a hosr environment
                     (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the <br> object of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as 
                    operators, control structures and statement. Core JavaScript can be extended <br>for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with 
                    additional objects; for example:

                    <ul>

            </header>

           <div class="content">
        <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways and fundamentally different in some other way. JavaScript resembles java but does not have 
            Java's static typing and strong type checking. Javascript follow <br> most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control flow 
            constructs which was the reson why it was renamed from Live Script to JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes, built by declarations, JavaScript supports a run time system based on a number of data 
            types representing numeric, Boolean, and string vaalues. JavaScript has a <br>prototype-based object model instead of the more common class based 
            object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheriance; tha is, whatb is inherited can vary for individual objects.<br>
            JavaScript also supports functions without nay special declarative requirements. Functions can be proprties of objects, executing as loosely
            typed methods.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be
            concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you don not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function 
            function return types are not explicitly typed.

           <p>
               To get started with writing JavaScript, open the scratchpad and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code.
           </p>

           <code>
               function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello "+ yourName); }<br>
               greetMe("World");
           </code>

        <div class="content">

           <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
           </p>

           <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).
           </p>

           <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also use 
            the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name

           <div class="content">
               <p>
                You can declare a variable in two ways:
               </p>

               <ul>
                   <li>
                    With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending 
                    on the execution context.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                    With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable.
                   </li>
               </ul>
               
           </div>
        </section>

        <a name="var_scope"></a>
        <section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h3> Variable scope </h3>
            </header>

            <div class="content">

            <p>
                When you declare a variable outside any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code 
                in the current document. When you declare a variale within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available 
                within that variable only.
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015, does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to 
                the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x 
                is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>

            <code>
                if (true) {var x=5;} console.log(x);//5
            </code>

            <p>
                This behaviour changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
            </p>

            <code>
                if (true) {let y=5;} console.log(y);// Reference Error: y is not defined
            </code>

        </div>

        </section>

        <a name="glob_var"></a>
        <section id="Global_variables" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h3>Global variables</h3>
            </header>
            
            <div class="content">
            <p>
                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.In web pages, the global object is window, so you can set and access 
                global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window 
                or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe 
                as parent.phoneNumb

                <h3> Constants </h3>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable 
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>

                <code>
                    const Pi=3.14;
                </code>

                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is 
                    assumed to represent a variable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>

                <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR<br>
                    function f() {};<br>
                    const f = 5;<br>
                    <br>

                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO<br>
                    function f() { <br>
                    const g = 5;<br>
                    var g; <br>

                    //statements <br>
                    }
                </code>

                <p>
                    However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
                </p>

                <code>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'};<br>
                    MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue';

                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean, true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or 
                                any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined</li>
                            <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"</li> 
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>

                <p>
                    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the 
                    condition is false. An if statement looks like this:
                </p>

                <code>
                    if (condition) { <br>
                        statement_1; <br>
                      } else {       <br>
                        statement_2; <br>
                      }
                </code>

                <p>
                    condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false.
                    If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed. Otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any 
                    statement, including further nested if statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>

                <code>
                    if (condition_1) { <br>
                        statement_1;  <br>
                      } else if (condition_2) {  <br>
                        statement_2;  <br>
                      } else if (condition_n) {  <br>
                        statement_n;  <br>
                      } else {  <br>
                        statement_last;  <br>
                      }
                </code>

                <p>
                    In the case of multiple conditions, only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, 
                    group them within a block statement ({ … }). In general, it's good practice to always use block statements—especially when nesting if statements:
                </p>

                <code>
                    if (condition) {
                        statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true; <br>
                        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; <br>
                      } else { <br>
                        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br>
                        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br>
                      }
                </code>

                <p>
                    It is advisable to not to use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality whwn glancing 
                    over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                </p>

                <code>
                    if (x=y) {/*statements here*/}
                </code>

                <p>
                    If you need touse an assignment in a conditional expression, a commonpractice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                </p>

                <code>
                    if ((x=y)) {/* statements here */}
                </code>
            </div>

                <p>
                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
                </p>

                <code>
                    while(condition) statement
                </code>

                <p>
                    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested 
                    again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>

                <p>Example</p>

                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

                <code>
                    var n = 0; <br>
                    var x = 0; <br>
                    while (n < 3) {  <br>
                    n++;  <br>
                    x += n;  <br>
                    }
                </code>

                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {}.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>

                <code>
                    function square(number) { <br>
                        return number*number;
                    }
                </code>

                <p>The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of 
                    the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The statement return specifies the value returned by the function:</p>

            <code>return number*number;</code>

            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function 
               changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
